**What is this?**
> This is a set of tools for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, made into a convenient overlay file for ease-of-use.

**What's in it?**
> Text2Item, Walk Through Walls, Move fast, Free-camera, Shader editor, Shops never close, and Time travel as well as others.

**How do I use this?**
> That's easy! Just go to the releases page, download the file, and put it in "switch/.overlays" on your SD card. It doesn't get more simpler than that! (A hacked Switch with Tesla and NXOvlLoader is required.)

**Text2Item does not work! Why not?**
> This issue has been worked on in the newest build. However, it was pointed out by user orc4ow that certain sys-modules may cause certain cheats to not work as intended. (This seems to only affect cheats that write to HEAP). Try disabling them and then try again.

**Something isn't working! What did I do wrong?**
> Chances are, it's an error on my part. Please reach out to me here, or on my YouTube page if you are having an issue so I can guide you through it. Thanks! 

**I am getting a memory read error. How come?**
> Close and re-open the menu. This error may happen when the game crashes, and you reopen the game without restarting the menu.

**Orville says there is interference when I try to visit a friend.**
> This is the games anti-cheat in action. Simply go into the 'Others' submenu, and click 'Disable Everything'. It will then allow you to travel. You may enable your codes again after you arrive into their island. The error will still occur if a player is in a menu, or someone is currently joining.
